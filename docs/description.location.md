Description meta tags `<meta name="description"></meta>` describes an HTML5 document. The description shows up in SERPs (search engine result pages) and informs users on what your page is about. If they deem it relevant to what they have been searching for they will click on it. It is very important to be relevant else users will hit the back button and that will be bad for your page rank.

These descriptions have to be in the page header.

```
<head>
	<meta name="description" content="Your relevant description done in under 160 characters"/></meta>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Add unique meta descriptions to every HTML5 document in your site. Keep them inside the `<head></head>` tags.
