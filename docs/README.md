# @passmarked/seo guides

[Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) is a suite of tests that can be run against any page/website to identify issues with parity to most online tools in one package.

The [Terminal Client](http://npmjs.org/package/passmarked) is intended for use by developers to integrate into their workflow/CI servers but also integrate into their own application that might need to test websites and provide realtime feedback.

All of the checks on [Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) can be voted on importance and are [open-sourced](http://github.com/passmarked/suite), to encourage community involvement in fixing and adding new rules. We are building the living Web Standard and love any [contributions](#contributing).

The documentation for every rule is listed in this folder is cached and read by [Passmarked](https://passmarked.com) to display content for our [Library](https://passmarked.com/library) of guides which detail why and how to solve the problems being tested in this module.

## Contributing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:passmarked/seo.git
npm install
npm test
```

Pull requests have a prerequisite of passing tests. If your contribution is accepted, it will be merged into `develop` (and then `master` after staging tests by the team) which will then be deployed live to [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) and on NPM for everyone to download and test.
