Page is blocked for any search indexing by `Googlebot`. This prevents Google from from indexing the page and makes it difficult for people to find it via a google search.

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure there is nothing in the ```robots.txt``` file that is disallowing the Googlebot bot.

```
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow:
```
